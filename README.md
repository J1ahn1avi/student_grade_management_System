# student_grade_management_System
## Concepts used:
1. Encapsulation:The Student class encapsulates the fields name and marks as private, and provides public setter (setDetails) and getter methods (getname, getmarks) to control access.
2. Method Overriding: In the GradeCalculator class, the calculatorGrade method is overloaded to handle both normal and bonus marks calculation.
3. Static Methods: The printHeading method in DisplayUtil is declared static so it can be called without creating an object. The main method is also static as required by Java entry point convention.
4. Ovject Oriented Programming (OOP): The code demonstrates key OOP principles such as encapsulation, class abstraction (Student, GradeCalculator, DisplayUtil), and object creation for handling multiple student entities.
5. Arrays of Objects: 	The students array in StudentGradeManager holds multiple Student objects, showing how arrays can store custom class instances.
